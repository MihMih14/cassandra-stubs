# Cassandra Stubs

PHP stubs for the php cassandra extension.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.3
* Cassandra php driver https://github.com/datastax/php-driver

Cassandra php driver (https://github.com/datastax/php-driver) hasn't 
appropriate version number. 
The only version number available is for C/C++ driver 
version (wich is not the version of the extension itself).
Because of it, version of this library follow the cassandra 
php-driver real version.

If you need to use cassandra php-driver v1.2.2, please install our library at 1.2.2
Follow the exact same logic for other available versions.
